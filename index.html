      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>My name is Jessica Russell and I am a rising junior Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute
        of Technology. I currently participate in several clubs and design teams, most notably as the
        Promotional/Sponsorship Lead for the Rose Grand Prix Engineering team and the Secretary to the Rose Rocketry
        Team. I have participated in numerous projects since starting at Rose, and have most recently worked
        on building and launching a high-powered rocket. Despite not being my most usual subject for a project,
        it was certainly an exciting one.
      </p>
      <p>However, regardless of the engineering work I currently immerse myself in, I am also an artist, and have been
        for most of my life.
        I absolutely love art at any level, and I am particularly practiced in digital and traditional style artwork. I
        can get carried
        away in designs and tend to develop story lines and plots in my free time. I have also gained
        experience in making promotional fliers, logos, extensive designs (for engineering as well as story creation),
        and complete visual
        media in the form of digital mockups, comics, animation, etc.
