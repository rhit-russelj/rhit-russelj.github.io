        <h2>RoseGPE Race Car Building - Team Building</h2>

        <p>Club recruiting season of the school year is fairly busy for me as the Promotional and Sponsorship lead for the Rose Grand Prix Engineering (RoseGPE) team.<br>
        As the summer comes to a close, not only do I work with the rest of the team to plan promotional social media posts and what we will want to be doing for the club fair, <br>
        but I also meet with new recruits, create promotional materials including flyers and stickers, and help with mediation between students who want to learn more about us.<br>
        On the sponsorship side of things, I work to make sure current sponsorship agreements don't expire, expired agreements get renewed, and new sponsorships are taken care of <br>
        for our many, many various tools and software programs so that our design and competition periods go as smoothly as possible.</p>

      <h2>Level 1 High-Powered-Rocket (HPR) Certified for Rocket Flight</h2>
      <img id="profilePic" width="200" src="Rocketry.JPG"/>
      <p>As part of the Rose Rocketry Team, it was inevitable that I would be building my own rocket, especially if <br> I wanted to be Level 1 High-Powered-Rocket certified! It was so awesome, and I had so much fun learning how to fly this high-powered rocket! <br> I am continuing to learn about rockets as I serve as the Secretary to the Rose Rocketry Team.</p>
